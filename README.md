funball

HI
This is a work in progress, but it is an HTML 5 game using Node.js and Processing.js - the game's objective is to push the opposing ball out of the circle (like sumo wrestling) and have FUNBALL


To start: 
1. In the terminal type "node server"
2. Navigate to "localhost:8989" in browser type 1 (such as chrome)
3. Navigate to "localhost:8989" in browser type 2 (such as IE or FF)
4. Arrow keys to move
5. Enjoy the out of sync FUNBALL!
